### TODO

- Rate Modal -> allow rating + show results
- View public profile

- Deal with numeral phrases ie: "1 bitcoiner", "2 bitcoinerS"
- Follow button everywhere
- Follow -> mass connect page should update local instance
- CONTEXT -> change current user following/followers on the state
- Pagination -> When entries loaded still show the infinite loader, it will not be triggered to load more entries
- Add optional "Voted as Bitcoiner by the commmunity"
- Social icons links
